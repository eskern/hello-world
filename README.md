Getting started

Hello Readers!

I'm just completing a tutorial, so you can ignore this (unless you're some strange branch of masochist who enjoys reading useless things). But anyway, I like baking and all the pupper/doggos of the world! I look forward to further familiarizing myself with the world of GitHub and programming.
